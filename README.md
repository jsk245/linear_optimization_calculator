# Linear Optimization Calculator
## Description
This is a command-line tool that allows the user to solve a couple different problems related to linear optimization. It can:
1. Solve linear programming problems
2. Solve pure integer programming problems
3. Solve mixed integer programming problems
4. Setup a table for transportation problems
## Commands
### solve-mip
The solve-mip command is used to solve the first 3 types of problems listed above. It is immediately followed by a file name containing the information for the problem (formatting described below), and the solve-mip command has 3 options assocated with it:
1. --num-cutting-planes (used to change the number of cutting planes used in problems involving integers; default=3)
2. --outfile (prints the output to a file if desired)
3. --no-include-brackets (if you want the final tableau to be printed without brackets)

This is an example command using these options:

`python calculator.py mip_example5.txt --num-cutting-planes=1 --outfile=myfile.txt`
### setup-transport-problem
The setup-transport-problem command relates to the fourth type of problem listed above. It is immediately followed by a file name containing the information for the problem (formatting described below), and the setup-transport-problem command has 3 options assocated with it:
1. --method (decides what algorithm to use when setting up the table, where method=0 corresponds to the min-cost rule, method=1 corresponds to Vogel's method, and method=2 corresponds to Larson's method; default=2)
2. --outfile (prints the output to a file if desired)
3. --no-include-brackets (if you want the final tableau to be printed without brackets)

This is an example command using these options:

`python calculator.py setup-transport-problem transportation_example.txt --method=1`
### compare-simplex-speeds
The compare-simplex-speeds command relates to the first type of problem listed above, but it does not solve any specific linear programming problems. Instead, it is used to compare the speeds of the vectorized and unvectorized versions of the simplex method used to solve linear programming problems. The command auto generates random linear programming problems based on 3 args that immediately follow the command: a positive integer describing the minimum number of variables included in the generated lp problems, a positive integer describing the maximum number of variables included in the generated lp problems, and a positive integer describing the number of random lp problems generated. The command also has 2 options assocated with it:
1. --print-reps (prints a message each time 10% of the problems have been completed)
2. --ignore-np-warnings (ignores any warnings generated by numpy)

This is an example command using these options:

`python calculator.py compare-simplex-speeds 500 1000 100 --print_reps`
## Format

## Potential Sources of Error
Linear programming and transportation setup problems should be reliably solved using this calculator (or the calculator will return an error if there are no solutions), but problems involving variables that are restricted to integers may lead to some errors. Since integer programming is NP-hard, lots of computation is needed to solve many of these problems, and in this current implementation, there may be memory issues encountered if the tableaus become too large. Another issue is that to test if a value is an integer, I check if the value is within 1e-7 of a whole number, so if the values in these problems are very small, this may lead to incorrect answers. Finally, there may be issues with overflow in general if numbers are too small as solving these types of problems involve division.
